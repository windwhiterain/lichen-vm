# Open issues after the slot isomorphism

## 1. The compute graph block is red — a regression of the slot encoding

Ten `graph_jit` tests in `lichen-compute` are red (JIT **30/40**). What matters is the
change of the failure, not the count:

| point | reading |
|---|---|
| `9ed0ee4b`, the attribute squash | the ten `graph_jit` tests **pass** — 10/10, measured in a detached worktree |
| `4645b439`, the pair-shaped slot | JIT **29/40**, "was 20/40": the drop happened in the compound-slot commits *after* the squash |
| now | JIT **30/40**; nine of the ten stop in the low type, one on its refusal message |

So the earlier diagnosis — [graph-recording-rounds](graph-recording-rounds.md), measured on
`e659607e`: no dynamic write, an empty argument cell, the rule side holding no identity —
describes the *pre-squash* failure and no longer matches the tree.

**The current fault, measured.** Nine tests stop on `refine_class_low_type`'s "a class
states one shape" assertion, raised from `infer_template_low_types`. The node is an `Index`
whose class is already observed `USize` — the engine wrote the value the read selected —
while the transfer states the *slot* pair `Tuple([Some(Tuple([None, Some(USize)])), None])`
— the read selected a slot. One class, two statements: the engine states values, the
transfer states slots.

**The ruling:** settle which of the two a class states *before* the hand-off. The hand-off
(the check records the written class of a `compute.write` call's `.value`, keyed by the
apply node; the recording reads it instead of deriving it from the value graph) is the next
step after that, and its design still stands — but it cannot fix an assertion raised while
the kernel template's low types are computed.

## 2. Nothing else

Every other suite is green; the three counts above are the reading. Two smaller defects are
documented rather than left open:

- The apply-time diagnostic renders the compared *types*, so a value-level conflict recorded
  through the apply edge prints both sides alike ("expected Int, found Int"). Left as a
  documented limitation: no program reaches it today — the one that did was the stale-value
  conflict the mint fix closed
  ([shallow-depth-element-values](shallow-depth-element-values.md) §22) — and the smaller
  fix (fall back to the compared values when the two sides read alike) buys little.
- The apply's type-side value merge is load-bearing for refinement reporting
  ([apply-type-side-check](apply-type-side-check.md)).
